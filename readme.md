# Berlin BÃ¼rgeramt Appointment Bot
This repository was once forked from https://github.com/Sinnaj94/buergeramt-scan. So big thanks for the initial work!  
But now it got completely reworked to get the date of the free appointments and moreover to act as a telegram bot.  
## Demo
You can use this live bot by visiting https://t.me/buergeramtstermine_bot

## Usage
You can interact with the bot using the commands `/hilfe` , `/termin` or `/abbruch`  
So if you want to find days with free appointments, go to https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistungen/ choose your Dienstleistung and scroll to the button "Termin berlinweit suchen" and copy it's url to the clipboard (right click on the button).  
This will look like this  
```
https://service.berlin.de/terminvereinbarung/termin/tag.php?...
```
The button will look like this for searching all citizen's offices  
![](alle_buergeraemter.png)

or for a single citizen's office

![](einzelnes_buergeramt.png)

Then you just need to send `/termin` to the bot and append the URL you just copied

## Building
Just install all requirements with
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running
Edit the file config.py and insert your telegram bot token.  
Then run the bot with
```
python bot.py
```
## Debugging
Debugging is made easy by using https://code.visualstudio.com/ or (my recommendation) by using https://vscodium.com/

## Dockerizing
The bot can also be run inside a docker container. Here's how to.  
Create the container image
```
docker build -t buergeramtstermine_bot:latest .
```
Run the container
```
docker run -d <container id>
```
